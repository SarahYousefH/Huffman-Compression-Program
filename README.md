## About This Project ðŸ“˜
This Huffman Coding application is a powerful tool designed for lossless data compression. It efficiently compresses any type of file by utilizing variable-length codes based on character frequencies â€” the most frequent characters receive the shortest codes. This project not only demonstrates technical proficiency but also showcases custom implementations of heaps and trees, built from scratch, to manage the priority queue and the Huffman coding tree, ensuring optimal compression.

## Features ðŸŒŸ
- **Dynamic Compression:** Compresses a wide range of file types, adjusting codes dynamically based on content.
- **Custom Data Structures:** Implements priority queues and binary trees from scratch to manage character frequencies and encoding processes.
- **Lossless Decompression:** Ensures the original file is perfectly reconstructed from the compressed version.
- **Efficient Encoding and Decoding:** Displays a table of encodings for quick reference and efficient processing.


## Constructing the Huffman Tree ðŸŒ³
The Huffman tree is reconstructed using the frequencies of characters in the file:

1. **Min-Heap Construction**: A heap is built where each node represents a character and its frequency. Nodes with lower frequencies are prioritized.
2. **Tree Building**: The two nodes with the smallest frequencies are merged into a new node, which becomes their parent. This continues until the root of the tree is formed, which allows the Huffman codes to be generated.
This process is designed to maximize the compression efficiency by giving the shortest codes to the most frequent characters

## Encoding the Huffman Tree ðŸŒ± 
In the `encodeTree` method, a **pre-order traversal** (root, left, right) is used to encode the Huffman tree structure:

1. **Leaf Node Detection**: If the node is a leaf (it contains a character), the method writes a `1` followed by the **byte value** of the character.
2. **Non-Leaf Node**: If the node is not a leaf, the method writes a `0` and continues the traversal by recursively encoding the left and right children of the node.

This ensures the tree is encoded in a way that can later be fully reconstructed for decompression, while mainting a minimal size for the tree.


## What's Next? ðŸš€
- **Tree Visualization:** I plan to enhance the user-friendly graphical interface and add methods for efficient visualization of the Huffman tree. This feature needs further work, especially for larger files, to handle and display the tree structure effectively.
